Name: is palindrome.

this project is to determine if a chosen word or string of words is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase or string of characters that reads the same either backwards or forward. Examples include "mom", "race car", and "madam".

Instructions
To successfully determine this, we compare the characters located at the ends of the word;
        if they are same, we test the rest of the word.
        if they are different, we stop.
Stop condition: an empty word or a word containing a single character is a palindrome.
